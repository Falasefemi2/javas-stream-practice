ðŸ›’ Problem: Analyze a Grocery Order List

You are given a list of grocery orders, and you need to process them using Java Streams. Each order has:

    name (String): the name of the product

    category (String): the type of item (e.g., "Fruit", "Dairy", "Bakery")

    price (double): the price of the item

    quantity (int): how many were bought


âœ… Your Tasks (Using Java Streams)

    Group the items by category and sum up the total price per category.

    Filter all items where price > 10 and collect them into a list.

    Sort all orders by total cost (price * quantity) in descending order.

    Get a list of item names bought more than 5 times (quantity > 5).

    Compute the average item price across all orders.
